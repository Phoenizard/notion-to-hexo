# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not create a public issue. Use one of the following approaches:

- Use GitHub Security Advisories for a private disclosure.
- Open a private issue and mark it clearly as a security report.

Please include: steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any PoC code. Maintainers will respond promptly and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.

If you need to reach maintainers by email for an urgent issue, add an email address here or update this file.
